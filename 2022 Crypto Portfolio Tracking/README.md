# 2022 Crypto Portfolio

Here is the code for my [crypto portfolio series](https://andresberejnoi.com/category/investing/crypto/2022-crypto-portfolio/). I update at the end of every month with a review of what happened during that period. My goal is to track the performance of this portfolio, comprised of the top 20 coins at the time I started it (December 23rd, 2021), and using a slighlty arbitrary weighting.
