# Plotting With Python

This repository contains tutorial code to show different types of plots and graphs that are possible with Python. 

I will create more notebooks in the future, as I write more blog posts. 

## Blog Posts
You can find the blog posts related to this folder here:
- [Plotting with Pandas and Matplotlib](https://andresberejnoi.com/how-to-create-plots-with-pandas-and-matplotlib/)

## Conda Environment
I used a conda environment to run the notebooks and Python examples here. You can recreate my environment using the `environment.yml` file generated by conda.

To recreate the environment, do the following:

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Also, my OS is Ubuntu 20.04, just in case.
