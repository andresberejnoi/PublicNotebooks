# Puppy Bar Chart Race

This bar chart race is done using the bar_chart_race Python package. I forked the original project to add some the ability to have images on each bar. 

I made a [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/9hqGRehzEsI) describing the process of how to use this feature. You should watch it to follow this notebook because I did not add enough comments here. 

## Data
All the csv and image data needed to run this notebook is included in the repository. Here is the link for donwload:

## My Forked Branch
To use the new feature of adding images to the chart, use my forked branch: https://github.com/andresberejnoi/bar_chart_race/tree/image_labels

Pay attention to the fact that you are using the branch `image_labels` and not `master` or `main`. 

## Original Repository
Here is the [original repository](https://github.com/dexplo/bar_chart_race) containing the code that I modified.
