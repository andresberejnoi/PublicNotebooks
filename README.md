# Public Notebooks 

A collection of public jupyter notebooks and maybe other things for sharing with other developers.

Here I will share projects that maybe are not big enough to warrant their own repository. This repository will contain mostly examples that I write about in [my blog](https://andresberejnoi.com/blog/).

## - SQLAlchemy Examples
This folder contains a small toy project using Flask and SQLAlchemy for a simple crypto purchase tracker (manually updated). The blog post covering this topic is [here](https://andresberejnoi.com/building-a-simple-flask-app-with-sqlalchemy/) and a follow up about querying a database with Python [here](https://andresberejnoi.com/how-to-use-sqlalchemy-and-python-to-read-and-write-to-your-database/).

## - 2022 Crypto Portfolio Tracking
I created a weighted portfolio of the top 20 cryptocurrencies at the beginning of the year. Every month I write an update about the performance. 

This folder contains the notebooks that I use to produce the charts in my posts. I also added the conda environment file that can be used to reproduce everything.
