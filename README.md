# Public Notebooks 

A collection of public jupyter notebooks and maybe other things for sharing with other developers.

Here I will share projects that maybe are not big enough to warrant their own repository. This repository will contain mostly examples that I write about in [my blog](https://andresberejnoi.com/blog/).

## - SQLAlchemy Examples
This folder contains a small toy project using Flask and SQLAlchemy for a simple crypto purchase tracker (manually updated). The blog post covering this topic is [here](https://andresberejnoi.com/building-a-simple-flask-app-with-sqlalchemy/) and a follow up about querying a database with Python [here](https://andresberejnoi.com/how-to-use-sqlalchemy-and-python-to-read-and-write-to-your-database/).

## Interactive Plots With Bokeh And Flask
This repository shows some examples of using the Bokeh library in combination with Flask to add interactive charts to a web application. If you want to read more about it, I wrote a blog post going over the code. You can read it at my blog, [here](https://andresberejnoi.com/interactive-plots-with-bokeh-and-flask/).

I also wrote another [post](https://andresberejnoi.com/advanced-plots-with-pandas-and-matplotlib-data-visualization/) about advanced plots with Pandas and Matplotlib.  

## Conda Tools
I created this repository to add some scripts with functionality that I need from conda. My main problem was that running `conda env export --from-history` would not include pip packages nor conda channels, or package versions. The script here solves that. However, I decided to create a separate repository for this project. 

You can find it here: [https://github.com/andresberejnoi/Conda-Tools](https://github.com/andresberejnoi/Conda-Tools)

## - 2022 Crypto Portfolio Tracking
I created a weighted portfolio of the top 20 cryptocurrencies at the beginning of the year. Every month I write an update about the performance. 

This folder contains the notebooks that I use to produce the charts in my posts. I also added the conda environment file that can be used to reproduce everything.
